title: Required database schema
description: The shipped schema-flow YAML, consumed mixins from @smplcty/schema-std, and the functions the library calls.
---

The library ships its schema as schema-flow YAML under `@smplcty/auth/schema/`.
It does **not** run migrations — you own that. Generic mixins (`audit`,
`soft_delete`) are **consumed from
[`@smplcty/schema-std`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smplcty/schema-std)**,
parameterized to auth's `users` table + `app.actor_id`. The library also owns the
**grants** on its tables, **role-aware RLS** on the identity tables, and the RLS
helper functions plus `auth_create_user` — so a consuming app drops the schema in
and writes only its own domain.

## Consuming with schema-flow

Import auth's schema and `@smplcty/schema-std` from your schema-flow config (see
the shipped `schema-flow.config.yaml`):

```yaml
default:
  imports:
    - package: '@smplcty/schema-std' # generic mixins → users / user_id / app.actor_id
    - package: '@smplcty/auth' # identity/tenant/auth_domains + resolve_session/current_user_id
```

The `audit` mixin makes `created_by`/`updated_by` NOT NULL, stamped from
`app.actor_id`. Migration seeds have no request actor, so the shipped `post/`
script back-fills them to the seeded **app-init** service user (resolved by name,
no pinned id) before the NOT NULL tighten phase.

## Grants

The library owns the grants on its tables — declared **explicitly per table**,
not via a blanket mixin, because the tables differ in sensitivity. They target
**two roles** the deployment provides (the library grants to them but does not
declare them):

- **`app_rls`** — the per-request, RLS-bound role. `SELECT` on reference data
  (`roles`, `communication_channels`); `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE` on the RLS-gated
  identity tables (`tenants`, `user_roles`, `user_communication_methods`,
  `auth_domains`); `SELECT/UPDATE` on `users`. It gets **no** access to the
  credential tables and **cannot** raw-INSERT a user or write reference data.
- **`app_privileged`** — the trusted, `BYPASSRLS` auth machinery, a **member of
  `app_rls`** (so it inherits the above). The library grants it the privileged
  delta directly: `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE` on `sessions` and `dev_otp_enrollments`,
  and `INSERT` on `users` (OIDC auto-provisioning). Role membership is one-way,
  so none of this is inherited back by `app_rls`.

No `DELETE` anywhere — every table is soft-delete, so removal is an `UPDATE` to
`deleted_at`. Sequence `USAGE` is auto-derived from the `INSERT` grants. The
library does **not** declare the roles: the consuming app (or its infra) owns
role creation, credentials, and the `app_privileged` → `app_rls` membership; on a
database where a role is absent the `GRANT` fails fast.

## Row-level security

The identity tables ship **role-aware, tenant-scoped RLS** keyed on `user_roles`
and the standard `user`/`settings`/`security` roles — see
[Authorization scope](/simplicity-auth/sessions/scope/#role-aware-rls-on-the-identity-tables).
The helper functions behind it (`current_user_id`, `auth_in_tenant`,
`auth_has_role`) are a [reusable contract](/simplicity-auth/sessions/scope/#the-rls-toolkit)
your own policies can call.

## Provisioning with `auth_create_user`

Raw `INSERT` on `users` is denied by RLS — a user must never exist without the
roles and contact methods that make it usable, and the grant of access must be
authorized. Create users through `auth_create_user(jsonb)` instead
(`SECURITY DEFINER`, atomic):

```sql
SELECT auth_create_user(jsonb_build_object(
  'name', 'Ada Lovelace',
  'communication_methods', jsonb_build_array(jsonb_build_object('channel', 'email', 'code', 'ada@acme.com')),
  'accesses', jsonb_build_array(jsonb_build_object('tenant_id', 5, 'role_id', 2))
));
```

It requires at least one communication method and one access, and checks
authority per access: the caller must hold `security` over every tenant being
granted — an all-tenants (`tenant_id` null) grant requires holding `security`
globally. A tenant-scoped admin therefore cannot create a global user or grant a
tenant it doesn't administer. OIDC auto-provisioning still runs through the
bypass pool.

## Soft delete

Every table carries `soft_delete` (`deleted_at`). The library **honors** it —
`resolve_session`, `validateSession`, `findUserByCommunicationMethod`,
`getUserRoleNames`, and the flat-tenant preset all exclude soft-deleted rows.
Unique indexes are partial (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) so a name/code can be
reused after archive. Setting/clearing `deleted_at` is a plain write your app
owns.

## Functions

All `SECURITY DEFINER`. The first two are called by the library's runtime; the
rest power the shipped RLS and are a stable contract your own policies can reuse.

| Function                              | Role                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resolve_session(hash)`               | **pure resolver** → `{ user_id, expires_at, roles[], default_role, privileges[] }`; validates nothing (validation/role-selection live in `withSession`)                  |
| `current_user_id()`                   | reads `app.actor_id` — the join key app RLS/scope functions should use                                                                                                  |
| `auth_in_tenant(tenant_id)`           | the current actor holds **any** role reaching that tenant                                                                                                               |
| `auth_has_role(role_name, tenant_id)` | the actor holds `role_name` over that tenant; a wildcard assignment reaches every tenant, and a `NULL` tenant requires **global** authority                              |
| `auth_can_admin_user(user_id)`        | the actor holds `security` over a tenant the target user belongs to (used by the `users`/`user_communication_methods` policies)                                          |
| `auth_create_user(jsonb)`             | authority-checked, atomic provisioning (user + communication methods + roles); the app's path to create a user since raw `INSERT` on `users` is closed under RLS         |
